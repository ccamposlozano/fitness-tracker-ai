# ðŸ“˜ CHANGELOG â€“ SmartFit AI-Powered Fitness Tracker

### ðŸ”¬ Model Experimentation â€“ Physical Activity Features

- Added physical activity variables (`PAD615`, `PAD645`, `PAD680`) from `PAQ_J.XPT` to the cleaned NHANES dataset
- Updated `clean_nhanes.py` to merge and filter these activity features
- Modified `train_model.py` to include these features in the input matrix
- Tuned `HistGradientBoostingRegressor` with GridSearchCV over `learning_rate`, `max_iter`, and `max_depth`
- Result:
  - RÂ² Score: -0.03
  - Cross-Validated RÂ²: -0.01
  - MSE: 175,726
  - Best Params: `{'learning_rate': 0.01, 'max_depth': 3, 'max_iter': 100}`
- Conclusion: Activity features degraded performance in current configuration, likely due to noise or weak correlation with dietary intake

### ðŸ§  Backend (ML)
- Replaced `RandomForestRegressor` with `HistGradientBoostingRegressor` to simplify pipeline and reduce overfitting risk
- Removed log-transform from calorie target after visualizing mild skew in distribution
- Used default parameters and 4 demographic/body measurement features (age, gender, height, weight)
- Evaluation:
  - RÂ² Score: 0.06
  - Cross-Validated RÂ²: 0.06
  - MSE: 145,209
- Visualized predicted vs actual calories as scatter plot


### ðŸ§  Backend (ML)
- Tried log-transforming calorie predictions â€” did not improve performance (RÂ² dropped slightly)
- Documented results with scatterplot and model evaluation
- Enabled timestamped filenames for model prediction plots

## 2025-06-02

### ðŸ§  Backend (ML)
- Added outlier filtering (1000â€“4500 kcal)
- Improved MSE significantly
- Added model evaluation metrics (MSE, RÂ²)
- Visualized predicted vs actual calories using matplotlib

## 2025-06-01

### ðŸ§  Backend (ML)
- Loaded real NHANES data using SAS `.XPT` files
- Merged demographic, body measures, and diet tables
- Trained initial RandomForestRegressor using 4 input features
- Added data cleaning script

## 2025-04-15 â†’ 2025-05-31 â€” Initial Setup (Backend + Frontend)

### Backend (FastAPI + Auth)
- Implemented user authentication (register, login, token-based auth)
- Set up SQLite database and SQLAlchemy models for users and macros
- Created protected routes with user context for macro predictions
- Connected backend to ML prediction pipeline for calorie/macro output

### Frontend (React + Tailwind)
- Initialized frontend with Vite, React, and TailwindCSS
- Built login/register UI with form validation
- Designed basic dashboard for showing predicted macros
- Connected to backend APIs with Axios
- Set up USDA food logging interface and added fallback for custom entries
